📊 Japanese Candlestick Pattern Detector
This project is a Python notebook designed to help traders and investors automatically identify Japanese candlestick patterns in stock or cryptocurrency price data. Candlestick patterns are a fundamental tool in technical analysis that can indicate potential changes in market direction.
The notebook simplifies the process by integrating data downloading, candlestick chart visualization, and the detection of specific patterns into a single place.
🌟 Key Features
* Automated Data Download: Uses the yfinance library to fetch historical price data for any ticker from Yahoo Finance.
* Interactive Visualization: Generates interactive and aesthetically pleasing candlestick charts with the mplfinance library.
* Candlestick Pattern Detection: Employs the TA-Lib library to identify a wide range of common candlestick patterns, such as Doji, Hammer, Engulfing, and many more.
* Analysis and Summary: Provides a clear summary of the detected patterns, indicating the type of pattern, the date it occurred, and a description of its possible market implications.
* Easy to Use: The notebook is designed to be executed step-by-step, with clear code cells and explanatory comments.
🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python: The main programming language.
* Jupyter Notebook: The working environment where the code is executed.
* yfinance: For downloading financial data.
* mplfinance: For creating candlestick charts.
* TA-Lib: For technical analysis pattern detection.
